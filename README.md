The most clutch, last-minute hackathon project ever for HackNY Fall 2015.

<br>A mobile-friendly, semi-responsive (but not really) <a href="http://conscou.github.io/Hackathon-Caffeine-Tracker/">website</a> that you may use to keep track of your caffeine consumption.

<br>The options were based on the most common brands of caffeinated drinks I have seen inthe previous hackathons I attended.

<br>Looking to expand this so that it is fully responsive, a Pebble app, and possibly some Twilio implementation!
